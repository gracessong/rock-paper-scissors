The biggest challenge was understanding the scope of function and nesting functions within functions keeping in mind the stack call order. Also it required a bit of thinking and planning in deciding what return value each function should produce. 

Used Replit to test each component of the function, Chrome Dev Tool for most debugging. Implemented the process of writing out pseudocodes/flow chart. Started commenting in the code. 

Learned that while top-down approach is effective for the planning/reducing-problem phase, it made sense (at least for this project) to start with the funtion that does the smallest action, so as to avoid reference errors in which the variables were used outside the scope of the function.

Rewrote JS with DOM to make the game interactive with barebone UI. May need to optimize the code to reduce redundancy, or to try the approach using e.target.id/className vs. manually assigning variables to the selector for each button.
